# Planned Revisions to Reproduction of Chakraborty (2021)

## Analysis: Proposed Modifications

To improve the Covid-19 Disability correlation study originally done by Chakraborty (2021), I plan to implement the following changes:

1\. Fix the color ramp of the county weights choropleth map (line 1850).

2\. Improve the format of the "missing data" table (line 351).

3\. Adding numbers to the figures to help the reader refer to them from the discussion. This reproduced study has more figures than the original study, so it is necessary to label the figures in order to refer to them.

## Results: Visualization and Interpretation

1\.  The new color ramp will have a wider range of values and will allow for smaller increments to be displayed on the map.

2\.  Reformatting the data table such that all of the data listed for the missing county is in one column will make all of the data visible on the page. This requires transposing the table.

3\.  Adding figure numbers will help the reader interpret the discussion. Emily's discussion refers to figure numbers but none are actually labeled.

## Discussion

1\.  The revised map will better emphasize the highest and lowest weighted counties. 

2\.  Including all of the values of missing data gives the reader a sense of what values may be missing from the analysis and how including them might change the results.

3\. Numbered figures will also help the reader navigate the chronology of the paper (at least, it was confusing for me which is why I had to write down the line numbers of the figures I was working on). This change will help readers navigating directly to the figure instead of having to do the work to find it. It will also be easier for readers to interpret the discussion because they can match the visual to the discussion.
